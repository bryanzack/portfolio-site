    <p>Hey, my name is Bryan and I'm a third year Management Information Systems student at Penn State Behrend. Although my degree of choice deals in both management and information systems, my goal is to pivot more into the latter and the likes. I enjoy video games, reading, movies, music, programming, and creating things; and I figured that combining the aforementioned in different ways would be a good way to build a small but respectable portfolio of projects.</p>
